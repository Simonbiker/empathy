# Empathy Test

## Overview
At Empathy, we're building a platform that will allow researchers to create and manage their research projects. One of the key components to this are surveys. Creating a survey is a collaborative process where multiple researches and team members will discuss what questions to ask to provide meaningful insight to the business. To do that they typical write out their script using Microsoft word and when all the changes have been made, they would build it using a full survey editor tool. 

### My Understanding
From my understanding of the task given to me, Is to create a simple survey notepad screen.  That people can use instead of Microsoft Word For creating scripts for their surveys.
The importance of this notepad screen is it speeds up the process of creating surveys and also updating them for the research platform.
